Booking system which was part of an university assignment where Object Orientated Design patterns had to be involved developing when designing and implementing the system. 

This was a group project where one member did the Presentation Layer. I did the domain layer and the data access layer was done in pair programming with the developer who did the presentation layer. A second group member created and maintained the test project and the unit tests.

This project made use of an ORM, ADO Level 3, so trying to run the application will result in an exception because the database can not be found. Should you want the application to run without the error open App.config and change the connection string inside the <connectString> tag then recompile.
